# Identity Operation Test
This test takes in integers, increments them by 1 and then multiplies them by 
10.

### Operator Workflow
  1) Increments data by 1, multiplies by 10, then emits
  2) Output (print) tuples

### Input data format
Format: ```number```
  * **number:** An arbitrary number ```i```

### Output format
Format: ```number```
  * **number:** An arbitrary number ```k```, where ```k = (i + 1) * k```
