# Vowel Counter Test
Takes in words line by line, and checks if they have two or more vowels and 
then emits (and then prints) only those strings that pass the two or more vowel 
filter.

In essence just one filter. 

### Operator Workflow
  1) Filter out words with less than two vowels
  2) Output (print) tuples

### Input data format
Format: ```string```
  * **string:** Lowercase sequence of chars

### Output format
Format: ```string```
  * **string:** Lowercase sequence of chars
